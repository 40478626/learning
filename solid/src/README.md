# S.O.L.I.D Principles (java examples)
**1. Single responsibility principle** 
- A class should have only one reason to change.

**2. Open/Closed principle**
- entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**3. Liskov Substitution Principle** 
- Child classes should never break the parent class type definitions.

**4. Interface Segregation Principle** 
- No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

**5. Dependency inversion principle** 
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
